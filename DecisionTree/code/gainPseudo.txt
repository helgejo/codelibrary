GainRatio(D,T) = Gain(D,T) / SplitInfo(D,T)

   where SplitInfo(D,T) is the information due to the split of T on the basis
   of the value of the categorical attribute D. Thus SplitInfo(D,T) is

		 I(|T1|/|T|, |T2|/|T|, .., |Tm|/|T|)

   where {T1, T2, .. Tm} is the partition of T induced by the value of D.

   In the case of our golfing example SplitInfo(Outlook,T) is 

	-5/14*log(5/14) - 4/14*log(4/14) - 5/14*log(5/14) = 1.577

   thus the GainRatio of Outlook is 0.246/1.577 = 0.156. And 
   SplitInfo(Windy,T) is 

	-6/14*log(6/14) - 8/14*log(8/14) = 6/14*0.1.222 + 8/14*0.807 
					 = 0.985

   thus the GainRatio of Windy is 0.048/0.985 = 0.049
