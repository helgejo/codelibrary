Baseline
Improved

Analysis
    Compare the baseline and improved systems on the query level.
    Create a plot that visualizes which queries improved and which degraded in the improved system, with respect to the baseline (use NDCG@10 as the basis of comparison).
    Identify the top 2-2 specific queries (with queryID and query content) that improved and degraded the most.
