# Computing statistics on the Adult dataset
# =========================================

# Task
# ----
#  - Compute frequency and mode for a selected categorical attribute.
#  - Compute mean, median, and variance for a selected continuous attribute, for each of the two classes (>50K, <=50K).

# Solution
# --------

# This standard import changes the default behavior of division to always
# return a floating point value.
from __future__ import division

# There are standard imports by now.
import csv
import numpy as np

# TODO load adult.data file

# TODO compute statistics
