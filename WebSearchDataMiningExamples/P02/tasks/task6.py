# Visualizing Adult data
# ======================

# Task
# ----
#   - This is an open-ended task. Explore the dataset using various visualizations. Time to unleash your creativity :)
#   - Some ideas:
#     * Create histograms for the categorical attributes.
#     * Discretize the `age` attribute and display it on a histogram. Experiment with different bin sizes.
#     * Create scatter plots with various pairs of continuous attributes (e.g., capital-gain vs. capital-loss).
#     * Try to add a 3rd or 4th attribute to the scatter plot by using different symbols/shapes, colors, sizes, etc.
#     * The adventurous ones can even try [Star plots](http://matplotlib.org/examples/api/radar_chart.html) or [Chernoff faces](http://healthyalgorithms.com/2012/11/12/dataviz-in-python-chernoff-faces-with-matplotlib/)

# Solution
# --------

# This standard import changes the default behavior of division to always
# return a floating point value.
from __future__ import division

# There are standard imports by now.
import csv
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# TODO load adult.data file

# TODO visualizations
